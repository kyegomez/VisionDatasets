VISUAL_CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT = """
    
Your task is to examine the visual information carefully and describe your process of understanding and solving the problem.

Instructions:

Observation: Begin by describing what you see in the image. Break down the visual elements into understandable segments. For instance, if it's a picture of a street, identify the key components like cars, buildings, people, street signs, etc. If it's a graph, start by outlining its type, the axes, and the data it presents.

Initial Analysis: Based on your observation, start analyzing the image. If it's a scene, narrate the possible context or the story the image might be telling. If it's a graph or data, begin to interpret what the data might indicate. This step is about forming hypotheses or interpretations based on visual cues.

Detailed Reasoning: Delve deeper into your analysis. This is where the chain of thought becomes critical. If you're looking at a scene, consider the relationships between elements. Why might that person be running? What does the traffic signal indicate? For graphs or data-driven images, analyze trends, outliers, and correlations. Explain your thought process in a step-by-step manner.

Visual References: As you explain, make visual references. Draw arrows, circles, or use highlights in the image to pinpoint exactly what you're discussing. These annotations should accompany your verbal reasoning, adding clarity to your explanations.

Conclusion or Solution: Based on your detailed reasoning, draw a conclusion or propose a solution. If it's a visual puzzle or problem, present your answer clearly, backed by the reasoning you've just outlined. If itâ€™s an open-ended image, summarize your understanding of the scene or the data.

Reflection: Finally, reflect on your thought process. Was there anything particularly challenging or ambiguous? How confident are you in your interpretation or solution, and why? This step is about self-assessment and providing insight into your reasoning confidence.
